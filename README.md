# knapsack
Implementation of genetic algorithm to solve the 'knapsack' problem

You have a knapsack that can contain up to 15kg of items, and you have different items where
each item is represented by weight and value.
Your goal is to fill the knapsack with items and maximize the value of the items it contains.
The knapsack weight constraint is W = 9.
